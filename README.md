The plugin is pre-installed in ONLYOFFICE Enterprise Edition, Community Edition (Document Server + Community Server), ONLYOFFICE cloud service, and ONLYOFFICE Personal. 

For ONLYOFFICE Integration Edition as well as ONLYOFFICE Document Server integrated with a 3rd-party storage (e.g. ownCloud, Nextcloud, Seafile) manual installation is required. 

## How to use

2. Among search results, choose ones you want to add to your document.

3. Choose style (e.g. Chicago Manual, American Psychological Association) and language.

4. Press `Insert citation`.

## How to install

For **Integration Edition and Document Server integrated with a 3rd-party storage** (e.g. ownCloud, Nextcloud, Seafile) two installation ways are available:

1. Put the folder with Mendeley plugin (it must contain the content of the src folder only) to ONLYOFFICE Document Server folder depending on the operating system:

    For Linux - `/var/www/onlyoffice/documentserver/sdkjs-plugins/`.

    For Windows - `%ProgramFiles%\ONLYOFFICE\DocumentServer\sdkjs-plugins\`.

    The plugins will be available to all the users users of ONLYOFFICE Document Server.
    No service restart is required.

2. Edit the Document Server config to add the following lines:

    ```
    var docEditor = new DocsAPI.DocEditor("placeholder", {
        "editorConfig": {
            "plugins": {
                "autostart": [
                    "asc.{BE5CBF95-C0AD-4842-B157-AC40FEDD9441}",
                    ...
                ],
                "pluginsData": [
                    "https://example.com/path/to/mendeley/config.json",
                    ...
                ]
            },
            ...
        },
        ...
    });
    ```
**Important**: when you integrate ONLYOFFICE Document Server with a 3rd-party storage, you need to use special connectors (integration apps). If you compile a connector from source code or create a new one, you can add plugins using Document Server config. If you use ready connectors (e.g. from ownCloud/Nextcloud marketplaces) adding plugins via config is not applicable. 

Mendeley plugin is installed by default for **Enterprise and Community Edition**.
In case you need to install it yourself, do the following:

1. Clone repository

    ```
    git clone --branch community-server https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/onlyoffice-mendeley.git
    ```

2. Copy `onlyoffice-mendeley` directory to `<community-server>\web\studio\ASC.Web.Studio\ThirdParty\plugin\mendeley`
